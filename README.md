# Viers-Web

# Final Project Component

## Design Mockup Viers

### Project Name
Viers

### Problem Domain
Efficiency / Student-led

### Problem Overview
It was difficult to check how crowded study spots, RSF, and cafes were before actually going to these places.
Libraries, MLK Building, RSF are too crowded
RSF Crowd Level Website is not very accurate
Waste of time and energy to just find a good study space before studying.

### Solution Overview
Centralize the checking and uploading of crowd level in one web that centers the popular spots within university
Use the app as a community-driven initiative to improve the overall efficiency of traveling within University.
Use the app as way of recommending spots because app is based on location and university (school email logins), all less crowded suggestions should be beneficial
Add in a messaging feature within the app to help with ascertaining the level of crowd

### Plan of Attack
The main view will contain the list of spots from less to more crowded in the category of libraries, sports facilities and cafeteria
The profile page will have the userâ€™s name, nickname, date of birth, etc.
The message page will have the messenger interface between two or grouped users
